## Overview
MathBin is a simple math equation editor that lets you write math equations in latex form and see the equation in HTML. Amazingly, the only way to view formatted math equations online today is through a special math parser that does not ship with browsers. 

This means that everyone who wants to render math equations on their website has to include a special parser and setup special subroutines to handle the math equations. Very few people have done this, and this I believe, has lead to very little math being published online for both educational and academic purposes, which is obviously a bummer. 

Anyways, I wrote MathBin as a standalone website, so that anyone can write and more importantly save a math equation online. After the equation is saved to a url like the two equations I attached, it can easily be included in any website that wants to add them. Hopefully this will help more people write and read math going forward.
